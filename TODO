make a function which can take a function input which yields the input for
each chunk to allow for larger data sets
make a method like `speedglm` which computes the cross product of the weighted
design matrix which is faster but less stable
the Armadillo `rows` may be slow when the copy is made? 
there may be an overhead with the current abstract family class
fix issue with order in `summary.glm`
